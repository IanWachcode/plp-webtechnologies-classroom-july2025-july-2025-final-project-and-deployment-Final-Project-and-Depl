Create a professional portfolio site that:

Showcases your work and skills, with clear case studies or project tiles.

Builds credibility (bio, testimonials, measurable results).

Converts visitors into leads/clients via clear CTAs (contact, hire, request quote).

Serves as a living resume for recruiters, clients, and collaborators.

Pages — overview (URLs + goals)

Home — /
Goal: quick intro + hook, direct visitors to portfolio or services.
Primary CTAs: View portfolio, Hire / Get a quote.

About / Bio — /about
Goal: humanize you, show experience, values, short timeline + download resume.
Primary CTAs: Read portfolio, Contact me, Download resume.

Portfolio — /portfolio
Goal: display work / case studies that prove capability.
Primary CTAs: View case study, Request a project estimate.

Services / Pitch — /services
Goal: explain what you offer, pricing models or packages, process.
Primary CTAs: Start a project / Book a discovery call.

Contact — /contact
Goal: make contacting trivial (form + alternative channels).
Primary CTAs: Submit inquiry, Book calendar.

(You had four items — I’ve expanded “About/Portfolio” into separate pages for clarity, but if you want exactly four, we can combine About + Portfolio into one /about page.)
